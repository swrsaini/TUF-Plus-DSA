# Majority Element-I
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the majority element of the array.
The majority element of an array is an element that appears more than n/2 times in the array. The array is guaranteed to have a majority element.

# Examples:
Input: nums = [7, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 2, 7, 7]

Output: 7

Explanation: The number 7 appears 5 times in the 9 sized array

Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]

Output: 1

Explanation: The number 1 appears 4 times in the 6 sized array

Input: nums = [-1, -1, -1, -1]

Output:
-1

# Constraints:
- n == nums.length.
- 1 <= n <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- One value appears more than n/2 times.
