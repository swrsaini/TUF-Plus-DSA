# Print the matrix in spiral manner
Given an M * N matrix, print the elements in a clockwise spiral manner. Return an array with the elements in the order of their appearance when printed in a spiral manner.


## Examples:
Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4 ,5 ,6], [7, 8, 9]]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

Explanation: The elements in the spiral order are 1, 2, 3 -> 6, 9 -> 8, 7 -> 4, 5

Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 6, 5]

Explanation: The elements in the spiral order are 1, 2, 3, 4 -> 8, 7, 6, 5

Input: matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]

Output:

## Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100
