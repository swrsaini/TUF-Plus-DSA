# Rearrange array elements by sign
Given an integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.Return the answer array in such a way that the given conditions are met:

- Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
- For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
- The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

## Examples:
Input : nums = [2, 4, 5, -1, -3, -4]

Output : [2, -1, 4, -3, 5, -4]

Explanation: The positive number 2, 4, 5 maintain their relative positions and -1, -3, -4 maintain their relative positions

Input : nums = [1, -1, -3, -4, 2, 3]

Output : [1, -1, 2, -3, 3, -4]

Explanation: The positive number 1, 2, 3 maintain their relative positions and -1, -3, -4 maintain their relative positions

Input: nums = [-4, 4, -4, 4, -4, 4]

Output:

## Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= | nums[i] | <= 104
nums.length is an even number.
Number of positive and negative numbers are equal.
