# Sort an array of 0's 1's and 2's
Given an array nums consisting of only 0, 1, or 2. Sort the array in non-decreasing order. The sorting must be done in-place, without making a copy of the original array.


## Examples:
Input: nums = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

Explanation: The nums array in sorted order has 2 zeroes, 2 ones and 1 two

Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Explanation: The nums array in sorted order has 2 zeroes, 3 ones and zero twos

Input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]

Output:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums consists of 0, 1 and 2 only.
