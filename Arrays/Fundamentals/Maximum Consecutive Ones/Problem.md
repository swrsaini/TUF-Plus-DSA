## Example 1
Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Output: 3

Explanation: The maximum consecutive 1s are present from index 4 to index 6, amounting to 3 1s

## Example 2
Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: 0

Explanation: No 1s are present in nums, thus we return 0

## Example 3
Input: nums = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Output:
3

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
