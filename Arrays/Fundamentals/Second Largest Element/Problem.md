## Example 1
Input: nums = [8, 8, 7, 6, 5]

Output: 7

Explanation: The largest value in nums is 8, the second largest is 7

## Example 2
Input: nums = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]

Output: -1

Explanation: The only value in nums is 10, so there is no second largest value, thus -1 is returned

## Example 3
Input: nums = [7, 7, 2, 2, 10, 10, 10]

Output:
7

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums may contain duplicate elements.
