# Selection Sort
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm and return the sorted array.
A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all previous elements in the array.

## Example 1
Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.


## Example 2
Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]

Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.


## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums[i] may contain duplicate values.
